# Recommended Libraries

- Phaser 3 (Arcade Physics) — core engine, rendering, input, audio.
- Supabase Realtime — presence + broadcast over WebSockets.
- Vite — dev server and build tool.

Alternatives
- kaboom.js for quick prototypes.
- If not using an engine: PixiJS + Matter.js + Howler.js.

Notes
- Start with generated shapes (Phaser Graphics -> generateTexture). Add CC0 assets later if desired.
